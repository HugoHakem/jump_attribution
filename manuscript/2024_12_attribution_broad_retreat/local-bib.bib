  abstract = {Advanced deep-learning methods, such as transformer-based foundation models, promise to learn representations of biology that can be employed to predict in silico the outcome of unseen experiments, such as the effect of genetic perturbations on the transcriptomes of human cells. To see whether current models already reach this goal, we benchmarked two state-of-the-art foundation models and one popular graph-based deep learning framework against deliberately simplistic linear models in two important use cases: For combinatorial perturbations of two genes for which only data for the individual single perturbations have been seen, we find that a simple additive model outperformed the deep learning-based approaches. Also, for perturbations of genes that have not yet been seen, but which may be "interpolated" from biological similarity or network context, a simple linear model performed as good as the deep learning-based approaches. While the promise of deep neural networks for the representation of biological systems and prediction of experimental outcomes is plausible, our work highlights the need for critical benchmarking to direct research efforts that aim to bring transfer learning to biology.},

  abstract = {Recently, the power of unconditional image synthesis has significantly advanced through the use of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The task of inverting an image into its corresponding latent code of the trained GAN is of utmost importance as it allows for the manipulation of real images, leveraging the rich semantics learned by the network. Recognizing the limitations of current inversion approaches, in this work we present a novel inversion scheme that extends current encoder-based inversion methods by introducing an iterative refinement mechanism. Instead of directly predicting the latent code of a given real image using a single pass, the encoder is tasked with predicting a residual with respect to the current estimate of the inverted latent code in a self-correcting manner. Our residual-based encoder, named ReStyle, attains improved accuracy compared to current state-of-the-art encoder-based methods with a negligible increase in inference time. We analyze the behavior of ReStyle to gain valuable insights into its iterative nature. We then evaluate the performance of our residual encoder and analyze its robustness compared to optimization-based inversion and state-of-the-art encoders.

However, batch effects pose severe limitations to community-wide efforts to integrate and interpret image-based profiling data collected across different laboratories and equipment. To address this problem, we benchmarked seven high-performing scRNA-seq batch correction techniques, representing diverse approaches, using a newly released Cell Painting dataset, the largest publicly accessible image-based dataset. We focused on five different scenarios with varying complexity, and we found that Harmony, a mixture-model based method, consistently outperformed the other tested methods. Our proposed framework, benchmark, and metrics can additionally be used to assess new batch correction methods in the future. Overall, this work paves the way for improvements that allow the community to make best use of public Cell Painting data for scientific discovery.},

To address this, we propose CRADLE-VAE, a causal generative framework tailored for single-cell gene perturbation modeling, enhanced with counterfactual reasoning-based artifact disentanglement. Throughout training, CRADLE-VAE models the underlying latent distribution of technical artifacts and perturbation effects present in single-cell datasets. It employs counterfactual reasoning to effectively disentangle such artifacts by modulating the latent basal spaces and learns robust features for generating cellular response data with improved quality. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach improves not only treatment effect estimation performance but also generative quality as well.

Here, we address this question by quantifying how all mutations in one protein, JUN, alter binding to all other members of a protein family, the 54 human basic leucine zipper transcription factors. We fit a global thermodynamic model to the data to reveal that most affinity changing mutations equally affect JUN's affinity to all its interaction partners. Mutations that alter binding specificity are relatively rare but distributed throughout the interaction interface. Specificity is determined both by features that promote on-target interactions and by those that prevent off-target interactions. Approximately half of the specificity-defining residues in JUN contribute both to promoting on-target binding and preventing off-target binding. Nearly all specificity-altering mutations in the interaction interface are pleiotropic, also altering affinity to all partners. In contrast, mutations outside the interface can tune global affinity without affecting specificity. Our results reveal the distributed encoding of specificity and affinity in an interaction interface and how coiled-coils provide an elegant solution to the challenge of optimizing both~specificity and affinity in a large protein family.},

  author = {Bergstra, James and Bengio, Yoshua},
  abstract = {Grid search and manual search are the most widely used strategies for hyper-parameter optimization. This paper shows empirically and theoretically that randomly chosen trials are more efficient for hyper-parameter optimization than trials on a grid. Empirical evidence comes from a comparison with a large previous study that used grid search and manual search to configure neural networks and deep belief networks. Compared with neural networks configured by a pure grid search, we find that random search over the same domain is able to find models that are as good or better within a small fraction of the computation time. Granting random search the same computational budget, random search finds better models by effectively searching a larger, less promising configuration space. Compared with deep belief networks configured by a thoughtful combination of manual search and grid search, purely random search over the same 32-dimensional configuration space found statistically equal performance on four of seven data sets, and superior performance on one of seven. A Gaussian process analysis of the function from hyper-parameters to validation set performance reveals that for most data sets only a few of the hyper-parameters really matter, but that different hyper-parameters are important on different data sets. This phenomenon makes grid search a poor choice for configuring algorithms for new data sets. Our analysis casts some light on why recent ``High Throughput'' methods achieve surprising success---they appear to search through a large number of hyper-parameters because most hyper-parameters do not matter much. We anticipate that growing interest in large hierarchical models will place an increasing burden on techniques for hyper-parameter optimization; this work shows that random search is a natural baseline against which to judge progress in the development of adaptive (sequential) hyper-parameter optimization algorithms.},

Since the genome contains the information to encode all proteins, genomic language models (gLMs) hold the potential to make downstream predictions not only about DNA sequences, but also about proteins. However, the performance of gLMs on protein tasks remains unknown, due to few tasks pairing proteins with the coding DNA sequences (CDS) that can be processed by gLMs.In this work, we curated five such datasets and used them to evaluate the performance of gLMs and proteomic language models (pLMs). We show that gLMs are competitive and even outperform their pLMs counterparts on some tasks. The best performance was achieved using the retrieved CDS compared to sampling strategies. We found that training a joint genomic-proteomic model outperforms each individual approach, showing that they capture different but complementary sequence representations, as we demonstrate through model interpretation of their embeddings. Lastly, we explored different genomic tokenization schemes to improve downstream protein performance. We trained a new Nucleotide Transformer (50M) foundation model with 3mer tokenization that outperforms its 6mer counterpart on protein tasks while maintaining performance on genomics tasks. The application of gLMs to proteomics offers the potential to leverage rich CDS data, and in the spirit of the central dogma, the possibility of a unified and synergistic approach to genomics and proteomics.We make our inference code, 3mer pre-trained model weights and datasets available.},

While effective, GANs encompass issues such as training instability and mode collapse, and they do not accurately map images back to the model's latent space, which is necessary to synthesize, manipulate, and thus interpret outputs based on real images. In this work, we introduce PhenDiff: a multi-class conditional method leveraging Diffusion Models (DMs) designed to identify shifts in cellular phenotypes by translating a real image from one condition to another. We qualitatively and quantitatively validate this method on cases where the phenotypic changes are visible or invisible, such as in low concentrations of drug treatments. Overall, PhenDiff represents a valuable tool for identifying cellular variations in real microscopy images. We anticipate that it could facilitate the understanding of diseases and advance drug discovery through the identification of novel biomarkers.},

Such applications include identifying disease-associated screenable phenotypes, understanding disease mechanisms and predicting a drug's activity, toxicity or mechanism of action. Several of these applications have been recently validated and have moved into production mode within academia and the pharmaceutical industry. Some of these have yielded disappointing results in practice but are now of renewed interest due to improved machine-learning strategies that better leverage image-based information. Although challenges remain, novel computational technologies such as deep learning and single-cell methods that better capture the biological information in images hold promise for accelerating drug discovery.},

However, existing approaches have limited scalability and robustness in handling more than two domains, since different models should be built independently for every pair of image domains. To address this limitation, we propose StarGAN, a novel and scalable approach that can perform image-to-image translations for multiple domains using only a single model. Such a unified model architecture of StarGAN allows simultaneous training of multiple datasets with different domains within a single network. This leads to StarGAN's superior quality of translated images compared to existing models as well as the novel capability of flexibly translating an input image to any desired target domain. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a facial attribute transfer and a facial expression synthesis tasks.},

  abstract = {Closing the gap between measurable genetic information and observable traits is a longstanding challenge in genomics. Yet, the prediction of molecular phenotypes from DNA sequences alone remains limited and inaccurate, often driven by the scarcity of annotated data and the inability to transfer learning between prediction tasks. Here, we present an extensive study of foundation models pre-trained on DNA sequences, named the Nucleotide Transformer, ranging from 50M up to 2.5B parameters and integrating information from 3,202 diverse human genomes, as well as 850 genomes selected across diverse phyla, including both model and non-model organisms. These transformer models yield transferable, context-specific representations of nucleotide sequences, which allow for accurate molecular phenotype prediction even in low-data settings. We show that the developed models can be fine-tuned at low cost and despite low available data regime to solve a variety of genomics applications. Despite no supervision, the transformer models learned to focus attention on key genomic elements, including those that regulate gene expression, such as enhancers. Lastly, we demonstrate that utilizing model representations can improve the prioritization of functional genetic variants. The training and application of foundational models in genomics explored in this study provide a widely applicable stepping stone to bridge the gap of accurate molecular phenotype prediction from DNA sequence. Code and weights available on GitHub in Jax and HuggingFace in Pytorch. Example notebooks to apply these models to any downstream task are available on HuggingFace.},

  abstract = {Protein language models (pLMs) trained on large protein sequence databases have been used to understand disease and design novel proteins. In design tasks, the likelihood of a protein sequence under a pLM is often used as a proxy for protein fitness, so it is critical to understand what signals likelihoods capture. In this work we find that pLM likelihoods unintentionally encode a species bias: likelihoods of protein sequences from certain species are systematically higher, independent of the protein in question. We quantify this bias and show that it arises in large part because of unequal species representation in popular protein sequence databases. We further show that the bias can be detrimental for some protein design applications, such as enhancing thermostability. These results highlight the importance of understanding and curating pLM training data to mitigate biases and improve protein design capabilities in under-explored parts of sequence space.},

Deep neural networks are increasingly being used to navigate high-dimensional sequence spaces1. However, these models are extremely complicated. Here, by experimentally sampling from sequence spaces larger than 1010, we show that the genetic architecture of at least some proteins is remarkably simple, allowing accurate genetic prediction in high-dimensional sequence spaces with fully interpretable energy models. These models capture the nonlinear relationships between free energies and phenotypes but otherwise consist of additive free energy changes with a small contribution from pairwise energetic couplings. These energetic couplings are sparse and associated with structural contacts and backbone proximity. Our results indicate that protein genetics is actually both rather simple and intelligible.},

The presence of background RNA can lead to systematic biases and batch effects in various downstream analyses such as differential expression and marker gene discovery. In this paper, we explore the phenomenology and mechanisms of background RNA generation in dropletbased scRNA-seq assays and present a deep generative model of background-contaminated counts mirroring those mechanisms. The model is used for learning the background RNA profile, distinguishing cell-containing droplets from empty ones, and retrieving background-free gene expression profiles. We implement the model along with a fast and scalable inference algorithm as the remove-background module in CellBender, an open-source scRNA-seq data processing software package. Finally, we present simulations and investigations of several scRNA-seq datasets to show that processing raw data using CellBender significantly boosts the magnitude and specificity of differential expression across different cell types.},

Copy number alterations can affect large regions spanning whole chromosomes or the entire genome itself but can also be localised to only small segments of the genome and no methods exist that allow this multi-scale nature to be quantified. In this paper, we address this using Wave-LSTM, a signal decomposition approach designed to capture the multi-scale structure of complex whole genome copy number profiles. Using wavelet-based source separation in combination with deep learning-based attention mechanisms. We show that Wave-LSTM can be used to derive multi-scale representations from copy number profiles which can be used to decipher sub-clonal structures from single-cell copy number data and to improve survival prediction performance from patient tumour profiles.},

However, the convergence of GAN training has still not been proved. We propose a two time-scale update rule (TTUR) for training GANs with stochastic gradient descent on arbitrary GAN loss functions. TTUR has an individual learning rate for both the discriminator and the generator. Using the theory of stochastic approximation, we prove that the TTUR converges under mild assumptions to a stationary local Nash equilibrium. The convergence carries over to the popular Adam optimization, for which we prove that it follows the dynamics of a heavy ball with friction and thus prefers flat minima in the objective landscape. For the evaluation of the performance of GANs at image generation, we introduce the `Fr{\'e}chet Inception Distance'' (FID) which captures the similarity of generated images to real ones better than the Inception Score. In experiments, TTUR improves learning for DCGANs and Improved Wasserstein GANs (WGAN-GP) outperforming conventional GAN training on CelebA, CIFAR-10, SVHN, LSUN Bedrooms, and the One Billion Word Benchmark.},

However, their framework requires a slow iterative optimization process, which limits its practical application. Fast approximations with feed-forward neural networks have been proposed to speed up neural style transfer. Unfortunately, the speed improvement comes at a cost: the network is usually tied to a fixed set of styles and cannot adapt to arbitrary new styles. In this paper, we present a simple yet effective approach that for the first time enables arbitrary style transfer in real-time. At the heart of our method is a novel adaptive instance normalization (AdaIN) layer that aligns the mean and variance of the content features with those of the style features. Our method achieves speed comparable to the fastest existing approach, without the restriction to a pre-defined set of styles. In addition, our approach allows flexible user controls such as content-style trade-off, style interpolation, color \& spatial controls, all using a single feed-forward neural network.},

In a user study, domain experts also found the counterfactuals generated using our method significantly more realistic than counterfactuals generated from a previous method, and even indistinguishable from real images.},

These networks not only learn the mapping from input image to output image, but also learn a loss function to train this mapping. This makes it possible to apply the same generic approach to problems that traditionally would require very different loss formulations. We demonstrate that this approach is effective at synthesizing photos from label maps, reconstructing objects from edge maps, and colorizing images, among other tasks. Indeed, since the release of the pix2pix software associated with this paper, a large number of internet users (many of them artists) have posted their own experiments with our system, further demonstrating its wide applicability and ease of adoption without the need for parameter tweaking. As a community, we no longer hand-engineer our mapping functions, and this work suggests we can achieve reasonable results without hand-engineering our loss functions either.},

We also show that this Stochastic Weight Averaging (SWA) procedure finds much flatter solutions than SGD, and approximates the recent Fast Geometric Ensembling (FGE) approach with a single model. Using SWA we achieve notable improvement in test accuracy over conventional SGD training on a range of state-of-the-art residual networks, PyramidNets, DenseNets, and Shake-Shake networks on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet. In short, SWA is extremely easy to implement, improves generalization, and has almost no computational overhead.},

We combine the benefits of both approaches, and propose the use of perceptual loss functions for training feed-forward networks for image transformation tasks. We show results on image style transfer, where a feed-forward network is trained to solve the optimization problem proposed by Gatys et al in real-time. Compared to the optimization-based method, our network gives similar qualitative results but is three orders of magnitude faster.

BFLOAT16 is attractive for Deep Learning training for two reasons: the range of values it can represent is the same as that of IEEE 754 floating-point format (FP32) and conversion to/from FP32 is simple. Maintaining the same range as FP32 is important to ensure that no hyper-parameter tuning is required for convergence; e.g., IEEE 754 compliant half-precision floating point (FP16) requires hyper-parameter tuning. In this paper, we discuss the flow of tensors and various key operations in mixed precision training, and delve into details of operations, such as the rounding modes for converting FP32 tensors to BFLOAT16. We have implemented a method to emulate BFLOAT16 operations in Tensorflow, Caffe2, IntelCaffe, and Neon for our experiments. Our results show that deep learning training using BFLOAT16 tensors achieves the same state-of-the-art (SOTA) results across domains as FP32 tensors in the same number of iterations and with no changes to hyper-parameters.},

  abstract = {In profiling assays, thousands of biological properties are measured in a single test, yielding biological discoveries by capturing the state of a cell population, often at the single-cell level. However, for profiling datasets, it has been challenging to evaluate the phenotypic activity of a sample and the phenotypic consistency among samples, due to profiles' high dimensionality, heterogeneous nature, and non-linear properties. Existing methods leave researchers uncertain where to draw boundaries between meaningful biological response and technical noise. Here, we developed a statistical framework that uses the well-established mean average precision (mAP) as a single, data-driven metric to bridge this gap. We validated the mAP framework against established metrics through simulations and real-world data applications, revealing its ability to capture subtle and meaningful biological differences in cell state. Specifically, we used mAP to assess both phenotypic activity for a given perturbation (or a sample) as well as consistency within groups of perturbations (or samples) across diverse high-dimensional datasets. We evaluated the framework on different profile types (image, protein, and mRNA profiles), perturbation types (CRISPR gene editing, gene overexpression, and small molecules), and profile resolutions (single-cell and bulk). Our open-source software allows this framework to be applied to identify interesting biological phenomena and promising therapeutics from large-scale profiling data.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes a novel framework for generating synthesized PET images from MRIs to fill in missing PETs and help with Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis. This framework employs a 3D multi-scale image-to-image CycleGAN architecture for the end-to-end translation of MRI and PET domains together. A hybrid loss function is also proposed to enforce structural similarity while preserving voxel-wise similarity and avoiding blurry images. As shown by the quantitative and visual assessment of the synthesized PETs, this framework is superior to the state-of-the-art. Moreover, using these synthesized PETs helps improve the ternary classification of AD subjects (AD vs. MCI vs. NC). Specifically, assuming an extreme case where none of the subjects has a PET, feeding the classifier with MRIs and their corresponding synthetic PETs results in a more accurate diagnosis than feeding it with just available MRIs. Accordingly, the proposed framework can help improve AD diagnosis, which is the final goal of the current study. Ablation investigation of the proposed multi-scale framework as well as the proposed loss function, is also conducted to study their contribution to the quality of synthesized PETs. Furthermore, other factors, such as stopping criteria, the type of normalization layer, the activation function, and dropouts, are examined, concluding that the appropriate use of these factors can significantly improve the quality of synthesized PETs.},

Until recently, our understanding of the effects of structural variants was driven mainly by studying naturally occurring variation. New genome-engineering tools capable of generating deletions, insertions, inversions and translocations, together with the discovery of new recombinases and advances in creating synthetic DNA constructs, now enable the design and generation of an extended range of structural variation. Here, we discuss these tools and examples of their application and highlight existing challenges that will need to be overcome to fully harness their potential.},

To scale up influence functions to modern machine learning settings, we develop a simple, efficient implementation that requires only oracle access to gradients and Hessian-vector products. We show that even on non-convex and non-differentiable models where the theory breaks down, approximations to influence functions can still provide valuable information. On linear models and convolutional neural networks, we demonstrate that influence functions are useful for multiple purposes: understanding model behavior, debugging models, detecting dataset errors, and even creating visually-indistinguishable training-set attacks.},

Assuming that the experimental uncertainty is normally distributed, the additivities can be analyzed with statistical rigor and sets of compounds can be found that show significant nonadditivity. Nonadditivity analysis can not only detect nonadditivity, potential SAR outliers, and sets of key compounds but also allow estimating an upper limit of the experimental uncertainty in the data set. We demonstrate how complex SAR features that inform medicinal chemistry can be found in large SAR data sets. Finally, we show how the upper limit of experimental uncertainty for a given biochemical assay can be estimated without the need for repeated measurements of the same protein--ligand system.},

The design of these CDRs determines the antibody's affinity and specificity towards its target. Generative models, particularly denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs), have shown potential to advance the structure-based design of CDR regions. However, only a limited dataset of bound antibody-antigen structures is available, and generalization to out-of-distribution interfaces remains a challenge. Physics based force-fields, which approximate atomic interactions, offer a coarse but universal source of information to better mold designs to target interfaces. Integrating this foundational information into diffusion models is, therefore, highly desirable. Here, we propose a novel approach to enhance the sampling process of diffusion models by integrating force field energy-based feedback. Our model, DiffForce, employs forces to guide the diffusion sampling process, effectively blending the two distributions. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our method guides the model to sample CDRs with lower energy, enhancing both the structure and sequence of the generated antibodies.},

  abstract = {Recent advances in multiplexed single-cell transcriptomics experiments facilitate the high-throughput study of drug and genetic perturbations. However, an exhaustive exploration of the combinatorial perturbation space is experimentally unfeasible. Therefore, computational methods are needed to predict, interpret, and prioritize perturbations. Here, we present the compositional perturbation autoencoder (CPA), which combines the interpretability of linear models with the flexibility of deep-learning approaches for single-cell response modeling. CPA learns to in silico predict transcriptional perturbation response at the single-cell level for unseen dosages, cell types, time points, and species. Using newly generated single-cell drug combination data, we validate that CPA can predict unseen drug combinations while outperforming baseline models. Additionally, the architecture's modularity enables incorporating the chemical representation of the drugs, allowing the prediction of cellular response to completely unseen drugs. Furthermore, CPA is also applicable to genetic combinatorial screens. We demonstrate this by imputing in silico 5,329 missing combinations (97.6\% of all possibilities) in a single-cell Perturb-seq experiment with diverse genetic interactions. We envision CPA will facilitate efficient experimental design and hypothesis generation by enabling in silico response prediction at the single-cell level and thus accelerate therapeutic applications using single-cell technologies.},

Here we present a human `all-by-all' reference interactome map of human binary protein interactions, or `HuRI'. With approximately 53,000 protein--protein interactions, HuRI has approximately four times as many such interactions as there are high-quality curated interactions from small-scale studies. The integration of HuRI with genome3, transcriptome4 and proteome5 data enables cellular function to be studied within most physiological or pathological cellular contexts. We demonstrate the utility of HuRI in identifying the specific subcellular roles of protein--protein interactions. Inferred tissue-specific networks reveal general principles for the formation of cellular context-specific functions and elucidate potential molecular mechanisms that might underlie tissue-specific phenotypes of Mendelian diseases. HuRI is a systematic proteome-wide reference that links genomic variation to phenotypic outcomes.},

  abstract = {Disentangling model activations into meaningful features is a central problem in interpretability. However, the absence of ground-truth for these features in realistic scenarios makes validating recent approaches, such as sparse dictionary learning, elusive. To address this challenge, we propose a framework for evaluating feature dictionaries in the context of specific tasks, by comparing them against {\textbackslash}emph\{supervised\} feature dictionaries. First, we demonstrate that supervised dictionaries achieve excellent approximation, control, and interpretability of model computations on the task. Second, we use the supervised dictionaries to develop and contextualize evaluations of unsupervised dictionaries along the same three axes. We apply this framework to the indirect object identification (IOI) task using GPT-2 Small, with sparse autoencoders (SAEs) trained on either the IOI or OpenWebText datasets. We find that these SAEs capture interpretable features for the IOI task, but they are less successful than supervised features in controlling the model. Finally, we observe two qualitative phenomena in SAE training: feature occlusion (where a causally relevant concept is robustly overshadowed by even slightly higher-magnitude ones in the learned features), and feature over-splitting (where binary features split into many smaller, less interpretable features). We hope that our framework will provide a useful step towards more objective and grounded evaluations of sparse dictionary learning methods.},

Matching the aggregated posterior to the prior ensures that generating from any part of prior space results in meaningful samples. As a result, the decoder of the adversarial autoencoder learns a deep generative model that maps the imposed prior to the data distribution. We show how the adversarial autoencoder can be used in applications such as semi-supervised classification, disentangling style and content of images, unsupervised clustering, dimensionality reduction and data visualization. We performed experiments on MNIST, Street View House Numbers and Toronto Face datasets and show that adversarial autoencoders achieve competitive results in generative modeling and semi-supervised classification tasks.},

This is why pixel-space video prediction may be viewed as a promising avenue for unsupervised feature learning. In addition, while optical flow has been a very studied problem in computer vision for a long time, future frame prediction is rarely approached. Still, many vision applications could benefit from the knowledge of the next frames of videos, that does not require the complexity of tracking every pixel trajectory. In this work, we train a convolutional network to generate future frames given an input sequence. To deal with the inherently blurry predictions obtained from the standard Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss function, we propose three different and complementary feature learning strategies: a multi-scale architecture, an adversarial training method, and an image gradient difference loss function. We compare our predictions to different published results based on recurrent neural networks on the UCF101 dataset.},

In this paper, we show that the requirement of absolute continuity is necessary: we describe a simple yet prototypical counterexample showing that in the more realistic case of distributions that are not absolutely continuous, unregularized GAN training is not always convergent. Furthermore, we discuss regularization strategies that were recently proposed to stabilize GAN training. Our analysis shows that GAN training with instance noise or zerocentered gradient penalties converges. On the other hand, we show that Wasserstein-GANs and WGAN-GP with a finite number of discriminator updates per generator update do not always converge to the equilibrium point. We discuss these results, leading us to a new explanation for the stability problems of GAN training. Based on our analysis, we extend our convergence results to more general GANs and prove local convergence for simplified gradient penalties even if the generator and data distributions lie on lower dimensional manifolds. We find these penalties to work well in practice and use them to learn highresolution generative image models for a variety of datasets with little hyperparameter tuning.},

In this paper we present several improvements that make the Skip-gram model more expressive and enable it to learn higher quality vectors more rapidly.  We show that by subsampling frequent words we obtain significant speedup,  and also learn higher quality representations as measured by our tasks. We also introduce Negative Sampling, a simplified variant of Noise Contrastive Estimation (NCE) that learns more accurate vectors for frequent words compared to the hierarchical softmax.   An inherent limitation of word representations is their indifference to word order and their inability to represent idiomatic phrases.  For example, the meanings of Canada'' and "Air'' cannot be easily combined to obtain "Air Canada''.  Motivated by this example, we present a simple and efficient method for finding phrases, and show that their vector representations can be accurately learned by the Skip-gram model. "},

Much of this research is focused on explicitly explaining decisions or actions to a human observer, and it should not be controversial to say that looking at how humans explain to each other can serve as a useful starting point for explanation in artificial intelligence. However, it is fair to say that most work in explainable artificial intelligence uses only the researchers' intuition of what constitutes a `good' explanation. There exists vast and valuable bodies of research in philosophy, psychology, and cognitive science of how people define, generate, select, evaluate, and present explanations, which argues that people employ certain cognitive biases and social expectations towards the explanation process. This paper argues that the field of explainable artificial intelligence should build on this existing research, and reviews relevant papers from philosophy, cognitive psychology/science, and social psychology, which study these topics. It draws out some important findings, and discusses ways that these can be infused with work on explainable artificial intelligence.},

Models will in turn produce expressive outputs such as free-text explanations, spoken recommendations or image annotations that demonstrate advanced medical reasoning abilities.

In recent years, progress has primarily focused on parameter count, with recent models' capacities surpassing the size of the very datasets they were trained on. Here we propose an alternative direction. We show that large language models trained on codons, instead of amino acid sequences, provide high-quality representations that outperform comparable state-of-the-art models across a variety of tasks. In some tasks, such as species recognition, prediction of protein and transcript abundance or melting point estimation, we show that a language model trained on codons outperforms every other published protein language model, including some that contain over 50 times more parameters. These results indicate that, in addition to commonly studied scale and model complexity, the information content of biological data provides an orthogonal direction to improve the power of machine learning in biology.},

  abstract = {Advancements in high-throughput screening have enabled the exploration of rich phenotypic readouts like high-content microscopy, expediting drug target identification and mode of action studies. However, scaling these experiments to the vast space of drug or genetic manipulations poses challenges, as only a small subset of compounds show activity in screenings. Despite being widely used in various applications, machine learning methods have not shown a reliable ability to extrapolate predictions to scenarios involving unseen phenomena, specifically transforming an unseen control cell image into a desired perturbation. We present a generative model, the IMage Perturbation Autoencoder (IMPA), which predicts cellular morphological effects of chemical and genetic perturbations using untreated cells as input. IMPA learns perturbation-specific styles from generalized embeddings and generates counterfactual treatment response predictions in control cells. We demonstrate IMPA can predict morphological changes caused by small molecule perturbations on breast cancer cells. Additionally, we test IMPA on the unseen drug effect prediction task, showing improved performance over state-of-the-art generative models when compounds are structurally related to the training set. Finally, generalizability and capability to predict more subtle effects are showcased through its application to large microscopy datasets with hundreds of genetic perturbations on U2OS cells. We envision IMPA to become a valuable tool in computational microscopy for aiding phenotypic drug discovery, facilitating navigation of the perturbation space, and rational experimental design.},

However, they suffer from lack of spatial information and a trade-off of resolution and gene coverage, respectively. We propose DOT, a multi-objective optimization framework for transferring cellular features across these data modalities, thus integrating their complementary information. DOT uses genes beyond those common to the data modalities, exploits the local spatial context, transfers spatial features beyond cell-type information, and infers absolute/relative abundance of cell populations at tissue locations. Thus, DOT bridges single-cell transcriptomics data with both high- and low-resolution spatially-resolved data. Moreover, DOT combines practical aspects related to cell composition, heterogeneity, technical effects, and integration of prior knowledge. Our fast implementation based on the Frank-Wolfe algorithm achieves state-of-the-art or improved performance in localizing cell features in high- and low-resolution spatial data and estimating the expression of unmeasured genes in low-coverage spatial data.},

A core emerging idea is combining LLMs with chemistry-specific tools like synthesis planners and databases, leading to so-called ``agents.'' This review covers LLMs' recent history, current capabilities, design, challenges specific to chemistry, and future directions. Particular attention is given to agents and their emergence as a cross-chemistry paradigm. Agents have proven effective in diverse domains of chemistry, but challenges remain. It is unclear if creating domain-specific versus generalist agents and developing autonomous pipelines versus "co-pilot" systems will accelerate chemistry. An emerging direction is the development of multi-agent systems using a human-in-the-loop approach.

Understanding the reasons behind predictions is, however, quite important in assessing trust, which is fundamental if one plans to take action based on a prediction, or when choosing whether to deploy a new model. Such understanding also provides insights into the model, which can be used to transform an untrustworthy model or prediction into a trustworthy one. In this work, we propose LIME, a novel explanation technique that explains the predictions of any classifier in an interpretable and faithful manner, by learning an interpretable model locally around the prediction. We also propose a method to explain models by presenting representative individual predictions and their explanations in a non-redundant way, framing the task as a submodular optimization problem. We demonstrate the flexibility of these methods by explaining different models for text (e.g. random forests) and image classification (e.g. neural networks). We show the utility of explanations via novel experiments, both simulated and with human subjects, on various scenarios that require trust: deciding if one should trust a prediction, choosing between models, improving an untrustworthy classifier, and identifying why a classifier should not be trusted.},

  abstract = {Language models are thriving, powering conversational agents that assist and empower humans to solve a number of tasks. Recently, these models were extended to support additional modalities including vision, audio and video, demonstrating impressive capabilities across multiple domains including healthcare. Still, conversational agents remain limited in biology as they cannot yet fully comprehend biological sequences. On the other hand, high-performance foundation models for biological sequences have been built through self-supervision over sequencing data, but these need to be fine-tuned for each specific application, preventing transfer and generalization between tasks. In addition, these models are not conversational which limits their utility to users with coding capabilities. In this paper, we propose to bridge the gap between biology foundation models and conversational agents by introducing ChatNT, the first multimodal conversational agent with an advanced understanding of biological sequences. ChatNT achieves new state-of-the-art results on the Nucleotide Transformer benchmark while being able to solve all tasks at once, in English, and to generalize to unseen questions. In addition, we have curated a new set of more biologically relevant instructions tasks from DNA, RNA and proteins, spanning multiple species, tissues and biological processes. ChatNT reaches performance on par with state-of-the-art specialized methods on those tasks. We also present a novel perplexity-based technique to help calibrate the confidence of our model predictions. Our framework for genomics instruction-tuning can be easily extended to more tasks and biological data modalities (e.g. structure, imaging), making it a widely applicable tool for biology. ChatNT is the first model of its kind and constitutes an initial step towards building generally capable agents that understand biology from first principles while being accessible to users with no coding background.},

Our pSp framework is based on a novel encoder network that directly generates a series of style vectors which are fed into a pretrained StyleGAN generator, forming the extended {\textbackslash}mathcalW + latent space. We first show that our encoder can directly embed real images into {\textbackslash}mathcalW + , with no additional optimization. Next, we propose utilizing our encoder to directly solve image-to-image translation tasks, defining them as encoding problems from some input domain into the latent domain. By deviating from the standard "invert first, edit later" methodology used with previous StyleGAN encoders, our approach can handle a variety of tasks even when the input image is not represented in the StyleGAN domain. We show that solving translation tasks through StyleGAN significantly simplifies the training process, as no adversary is required, has better support for solving tasks without pixel-to-pixel correspondence, and inherently supports multi-modal synthesis via the resampling of styles. Finally, we demonstrate the potential of our framework on a variety of facial image-to-image translation tasks, even when compared to state-of-the-art solutions designed specifically for a single task, and further show that it can be extended beyond the human facial domain.

  abstract = {Neural networks are among the most accurate supervised learning methods in use today. However, their opacity makes them difficult to trust in critical applications, especially if conditions in training may differ from those in test. Recent work on explanations for black-box models has produced tools (e.g. LIME) to show the implicit rules behind predictions. These tools can help us identify when models are right for the wrong reasons. However, these methods do not scale to explaining entire datasets and cannot correct the problems they reveal. We introduce a method for efficiently explaining and regularizing differentiable models by examining and selectively penalizing their input gradients. We apply these penalties both based on expert annotation and in an unsupervised fashion that produces multiple classifiers with qualitatively different decision boundaries. On multiple datasets, we show our approach generates faithful explanations and models that generalize much better when conditions differ between training and test.},

Using our new techniques, we achieve state-of-the-art results in semi-supervised classification on MNIST, CIFAR-10 and SVHN. The generated images are of high quality as confirmed by a visual Turing test: our model generates MNIST samples that humans cannot distinguish from real data, and CIFAR-10 samples that yield a human error rate of 21.3\%. We also present ImageNet samples with unprecedented resolution and show that our methods enable the model to learn recognizable features of ImageNet classes.},

  abstract = {Labeled medical imaging data is scarce and expensive to generate. To achieve generalizable deep learning models large amounts of data are needed. Standard data augmentation is a method to increase generalizability and is routinely performed. Generative adversarial networks offer a novel method for data augmentation. We evaluate the use of CycleGAN for data augmentation in CT segmentation tasks. Using a large image database we trained a CycleGAN to transform contrast CT images into non-contrast images. We then used the trained CycleGAN to augment our training using these synthetic non-contrast images. We compared the segmentation performance of a U-Net trained on the original dataset compared to a U-Net trained on the combined dataset of original data and synthetic non-contrast images. We further evaluated the U-Net segmentation performance on two separate datasets: The original contrast CT dataset on which segmentations were created and a second dataset from a different hospital containing only non-contrast CTs. We refer to these 2 separate datasets as the in-distribution and out-of-distribution datasets, respectively. We show that in several CT segmentation tasks performance is improved significantly, especially in out-of-distribution (noncontrast CT) data. For example, when training the model with standard augmentation techniques, performance of segmentation of the kidneys on out-of-distribution non-contrast images was dramatically lower than for in-distribution data (Dice score of 0.09 vs. 0.94 for out-of-distribution vs. in-distribution data, respectively, p\,{$<$}\,0.001). When the kidney model was trained with CycleGAN augmentation techniques, the out-of-distribution (non-contrast) performance increased dramatically (from a Dice score of 0.09 to 0.66, p\,{$<$}\,0.001). Improvements for the liver and spleen were smaller, from 0.86 to 0.89 and 0.65 to 0.69, respectively. We believe this method will be valuable to medical imaging researchers to reduce manual segmentation effort and cost in CT imaging.},

Their ability to evaluate a wide spectrum of interventions, from single drugs to intricate drug combinations and CRISPR-interference, has established them as an invaluable resource for the development of novel therapeutic approaches. Nevertheless, the combinatorial complexity of potential interventions makes a comprehensive exploration intractable. Hence, prioritizing interventions for further experimental investigation becomes of utmost importance. Results We propose CODEX as a general framework for the causal modeling of HTS data, linking perturbations to their downstream consequences. CODEX relies on a stringent causal modeling strategy based on counterfactual reasoning. As such, CODEX predicts drug-specific cellular responses, comprising cell survival and molecular alterations, and facilitates the in-silico exploration of drug combinations. This is achieved for both bulk and single-cell HTS. We further show that CODEX provides a rationale to explore complex genetic modifications from CRISPR-interference in silico in single cells.

  abstract = {We propose a technique for producing `visual explanations' for decisions from a large class of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based models, making them more transparent. Our approach - Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM), uses the gradients of any target concept (say logits for `dog' or even a caption), flowing into the final convolutional layer to produce a coarse localization map highlighting the important regions in the image for predicting the concept. Unlike previous approaches, Grad- CAM is applicable to a wide variety of CNN model-families: (1) CNNs with fully-connected layers (e.g. VGG), (2) CNNs used for structured outputs (e.g. captioning), (3) CNNs used in tasks with multi-modal inputs (e.g. visual question answering) or reinforcement learning, without architectural changes or re-training. We combine Grad-CAM with existing fine-grained visualizations to create a high-resolution class-discriminative visualization, Guided Grad-CAM, and apply it to image classification, image captioning, and visual question answering (VQA) models, including ResNet-based architectures. In the context of image classification models, our visualizations (a) lend insights into failure modes of these models (showing that seemingly unreasonable predictions have reasonable explanations), (b) outperform previous methods on the ILSVRC-15 weakly-supervised localization task, (c) are more faithful to the underlying model, and (d) help achieve model generalization by identifying dataset bias. For image captioning and VQA, our visualizations show even non-attention based models can localize inputs. Finally, we design and conduct human studies to measure if Grad-CAM explanations help users establish appropriate trust in predictions from deep networks and show that Grad-CAM helps untrained users successfully discern a `stronger' deep network from a `weaker' one even when both make identical predictions. Our code is available at https: //github.com/ramprs/grad-cam/ along with a demo on CloudCV [2] and video at youtu.be/COjUB9Izk6E.},

Here we present DeepLIFT (Deep Learning Important FeaTures), a method for decomposing the output prediction of a neural network on a specific input by backpropagating the contributions of all neurons in the network to every feature of the input. DeepLIFT compares the activation of each neuron to its `reference activation' and assigns contribution scores according to the difference. By optionally giving separate consideration to positive and negative contributions, DeepLIFT can also reveal dependencies which are missed by other approaches. Scores can be computed efficiently in a single backward pass. We apply DeepLIFT to models trained on MNIST and simulated genomic data, and show significant advantages over gradient-based methods.

  abstract = {In computer science, an operation, function or expression is said to have a side effect if it has any observable effect other than its primary effect of reading the value of its arguments and returning a value to the invoker of the operation. Example side effects include modifying a non-local variable, a static local variable or a mutable argument passed by reference; raising errors or exceptions; performing I/O; or calling other functions with side-effects. In the presence of side effects, a program's behaviour may depend on history; that is, the order of evaluation matters. Understanding and debugging a function with side effects requires knowledge about the context and its possible histories. Side effects play an important role in the design and analysis of programming languages. The degree to which side effects are used depends on the programming paradigm. For example, imperative programming is commonly used to produce side effects, to update a system's state. By contrast, declarative programming is commonly used to report on the state of system, without side effects.  Functional programming aims to minimize or eliminate side effects. The lack of side effects makes it easier to do formal verification of a program. The functional language Haskell eliminates side effects such as I/O and other stateful computations by replacing them with monadic actions. Functional languages such as Standard ML, Scheme and Scala do not restrict side effects, but it is customary for programmers to avoid them. Assembly language programmers must be aware of hidden side effects---instructions that modify parts of the processor state which are not mentioned in the instruction's mnemonic. A classic example of a hidden side effect is an arithmetic instruction that implicitly modifies condition codes (a hidden side effect) while it explicitly modifies a register (the intended effect). One potential drawback of an instruction set with hidden side effects is that, if many instructions have side effects on a single piece of state, like condition codes, then the logic required to update that state sequentially may become a performance bottleneck. The problem is particularly acute on some processors designed with pipelining (since 1990) or with out-of-order execution. Such a processor may require additional control circuitry to detect hidden side effects and stall the pipeline if the next instruction depends on the results of those effects.},

  abstract = {Protein language models (PLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success in protein modeling and design, yet their internal mechanisms for predicting structure and function remain poorly understood. Here we present a systematic approach to extract and analyze interpretable features from PLMs using sparse autoencoders (SAEs). By training SAEs on embeddings from the PLM ESM-2, we identify up to 2,548 human-interpretable latent features per layer that strongly correlate with up to 143 known biological concepts such as binding sites, structural motifs, and functional domains. In contrast, examining individual neurons in ESM-2 reveals up to 46 neurons per layer with clear conceptual alignment across 15 known concepts, suggesting that PLMs represent most concepts in superposition. Beyond capturing known annotations, we show that ESM-2 learns coherent concepts that do not map onto existing annotations and propose a pipeline using language models to automatically interpret novel latent features learned by the SAEs. As practical applications, we demonstrate how these latent features can fill in missing annotations in protein databases and enable targeted steering of protein sequence generation. Our results demonstrate that PLMs encode rich, interpretable representations of protein biology and we propose a systematic framework to extract and analyze these latent features. In the process, we recover both known biology and potentially new protein motifs. As community resources, we introduce InterPLM (interPLM.ai), an interactive visualization platform for exploring and analyzing learned PLM features, and release code for training and analysis at github.com/ElanaPearl/interPLM.},

To accelerate sampling, we present denoising diffusion implicit models (DDIMs), a more efficient class of iterative implicit probabilistic models with the same training procedure as DDPMs. In DDPMs, the generative process is defined as the reverse of a particular Markovian diffusion process. We generalize DDPMs via a class of non-Markovian diffusion processes that lead to the same training objective. These non-Markovian processes can correspond to generative processes that are deterministic, giving rise to implicit models that produce high quality samples much faster. We empirically demonstrate that DDIMs can produce high quality samples 10{\texttimes} to 50{\texttimes} faster in terms of wall-clock time compared to DDPMs, allow us to trade off computation for sample quality, perform semantically meaningful image interpolation directly in the latent space, and reconstruct observations with very low error.},

  abstract = {Small RNAs hold crucial biological information and have immense diagnostic and therapeutic value. While many established annotation tools focus on microRNAs, there are myriads of other small RNAs that are currently underutilized. These small RNAs can be difficult to annotate, as ground truth is limited and well-established mapping and mismatch rules are lacking. TransfoRNA is a machine learning framework based on Transformers that explores an alternative strategy. It uses common annotation tools to generate a small seed of high-confidence training labels, while then expanding upon those labels iteratively. TransfoRNA learns sequence-specific representations of all RNAs to construct a similarity network which can be interrogated as new RNAs are annotated, allowing to rank RNAs based on their familiarity. While models can be flexibly trained on any RNA dataset, we here present a version trained on TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) small RNA sequences and demonstrate its ability to add annotation confidence to an unrelated dataset, where 21\% of previously unannotated RNAs could be annotated. Relative to its training data, TransfoRNA could boost high-confidence annotations in TCGA by {$\sim$}50\% while providing transparent explanations even for low-confidence ones. It could learn to annotate 97\% of isomiRs from just single examples and confidently identify new members of other familiar classes with high accuracy, while reliably rejecting false RNAs.

  abstract = {Optical coherence tomography (OCT) and confocal microscopy are pivotal in retinal imaging, each presenting unique benefits and limitations. In-vivo OCT offers rapid, non-invasive imaging but can be hampered by clarity issues and motion artifacts. Ex-vivo confocal microscopy provides high-resolution, cellular detailed color images but is invasive and poses ethical concerns and potential tissue damage. To bridge these modalities, we developed a 3D CycleGAN framework for unsupervised translation of in-vivo OCT to ex-vivo confocal microscopy images. Applied to our OCT2Confocal dataset, this framework effectively translates between 3D medical data domains, capturing vascular, textural, and cellular details with precision. This marks the first attempt to exploit the inherent 3D information of OCT and translate it into the rich, detailed color domain of confocal microscopy. Assessed through quantitative and qualitative evaluations, the 3D CycleGAN framework demonstrates commendable image fidelity and quality, outperforming existing methods despite the constraints of limited data. This non-invasive generation of retinal confocal images has the potential to further enhance diagnostic and monitoring capabilities in ophthalmology.

In this article, we will discuss machine learning approaches to address these types of translation and counterfactual problems. We will begin by giving an overview on single-cell biology applications and the relevant translation problems. Subsequently, we will provide an overview of approaches for multidomain alignment and translation in machine learning, including methods based on generative modeling, optimal transport, and causal inference. The bulk of this article will focus on how these approaches have been tailored and applied to important translation problems in single-cell biology, illustrated through concrete examples from our own work. We end with open problems and a perspective on how biology may not only be uniquely suited to being one of the greatest beneficiaries of machine learning but also one of the greatest sources of inspiration for it.},

The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.},

  abstract = {Heatmap regression with a deep network has become one of the mainstream approaches to localize facial landmarks. However, the loss function for heatmap regression is rarely studied. In this paper, we analyze the ideal loss function properties for heatmap regression in face alignment problems. Then we propose a novel loss function, named Adaptive Wing loss, that is able to adapt its shape to different types of ground truth heatmap pixels. This adaptability penalizes loss more on foreground pixels while less on background pixels. To address the imbalance between foreground and background pixels, we also propose Weighted Loss Map, which assigns high weights on foreground and difficult background pixels to help training process focus more on pixels that are crucial to landmark localization. To further improve face alignment accuracy, we introduce boundary prediction and CoordConv with boundary coordinates. Extensive experiments on different benchmarks, including COFW, 300W and WFLW, show our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art by a significant margin on various evaluation metrics. Besides, the Adaptive Wing loss also helps other heatmap regression tasks. Code will be made publicly available at https://github.com/ protossw512/AdaptiveWingLoss.},

  abstract = {High-throughput drug screening -- using cell imaging or gene expression measurements as readouts of drug effect -- is a critical tool in biotechnology to assess and understand the relationship between the chemical structure and biological activity of a drug. Since large-scale screens have to be divided into multiple experiments, a key difficulty is dealing with batch effects, which can introduce systematic errors and non-biological associations in the data. We propose InfoCORE, an Information maximization approach for COnfounder REmoval, to effectively deal with batch effects and obtain refined molecular representations. InfoCORE establishes a variational lower bound on the conditional mutual information of the latent representations given a batch identifier. It adaptively reweighs samples to equalize their implied batch distribution. Extensive experiments on drug screening data reveal InfoCORE's superior performance in a multitude of tasks including molecular property prediction and molecule-phenotype retrieval. Additionally, we show results for how InfoCORE offers a versatile framework and resolves general distribution shifts and issues of data fairness by minimizing correlation with spurious features or removing sensitive attributes.

Because ICB targets cell--cell interactions2, we investigated the impact of multicellular spatial organization on response, and explored how ICB remodels the tumour microenvironment. We show that cell phenotype, activation state and spatial location are intimately linked, influence ICB effect and differ in sensitive versus resistant tumours early on-treatment. We used imaging mass cytometry3 to profile the in situ expression of 43 proteins in tumours from patients in a randomized trial of neoadjuvant ICB, sampled at three timepoints (baseline, n\,=\,243; early on-treatment, n\,=\,207; post-treatment, n\,=\,210). Multivariate modelling showed that the fractions of proliferating CD8+TCF1+T cells and MHCII+ cancer cells were dominant predictors of response, followed by cancer--immune interactions with B cells and granzyme B+ T cells. On-treatment, responsive tumours contained abundant granzyme B+ T cells, whereas resistant tumours were characterized by CD15+ cancer cells. Response was best predicted by combining tissue features before and on-treatment, pointing to a role for early biopsies in guiding adaptive therapy. Our findings show that multicellular spatial organization is a major determinant of ICB effect and suggest that its systematic enumeration in situ could help realize precision immuno-oncology.},

  abstract = {Thousands of proteins have been validated genetically as therapeutic targets for human diseases1. However, very few have been successfully targeted, and many are considered `undruggable'. This is particularly true for proteins that function via protein--protein interactions---direct inhibition of binding interfaces is difficult and requires the identification of allosteric sites. However, most proteins have no known allosteric sites, and a comprehensive allosteric map does not exist for any protein. Here we address this shortcoming by charting multiple global atlases of inhibitory allosteric communication in KRAS. We quantified the effects of more than 26,000 mutations on the folding of KRAS and its binding to six interaction partners. Genetic interactions in double mutants enabled us to perform biophysical measurements at scale, inferring more than 22,000 causal free energy changes. These energy landscapes quantify how mutations tune the binding specificity of a signalling protein and map the inhibitory allosteric sites for an important therapeutic target. Allosteric propagation is particularly effective across the central {$\beta$}-sheet of KRAS, and multiple surface pockets are genetically validated as allosterically active, including a distal pocket in the C-terminal lobe of the protein. Allosteric mutations typically inhibit binding to all tested effectors, but they can also change the binding specificity, revealing the regulatory, evolutionary and therapeutic potential to tune pathway activation. Using the approach described here, it should be possible to rapidly and comprehensively identify allosteric target sites in many proteins.},

RIR robustly improves knowledge-intensive visual question answering (VQA) of GPT-4V by 37-43\%, GPT-4 Turbo by 25-27\%, and GPT-4o by 18-20\% in terms of open-ended VQA evaluation metrics. To our surprise, we discover that RIR helps the model to better access its own world knowledge. Concretely, our experiments suggest that RIR augmentation helps by providing further visual and textual cues without necessarily containing the direct answer to a query. In addition, we elucidate cases in which RIR can hurt performance and conduct a human evaluation. Finally, we find that the overall advantage of using RIR makes it difficult for an agent that can choose to use RIR to perform better than an approach where RIR is the default setting.},

In addition, we propose a new framework and algorithm for multi-domain translation based on learning the shared latent distribution and training autoencoders under distributional constraints. A key practical advantage of our framework is that new autoencoders (i.e., new domains) can be added sequentially to the model without retraining on the other domains, which we demonstrate experimentally on image as well as genomics datasets.},

  abstract = {Causal disentanglement aims to uncover a representation of data using latent variables that are interrelated through a causal model. Such a representation is identifiable if the latent model that explains the data is unique. In this paper, we focus on the scenario where unpaired observational and interventional data are available, with each intervention changing the mechanism of a latent variable. When the causal variables are fully observed, statistically consistent algorithms have been developed to identify the causal model under faithfulness assumptions. We here show that identifiability can still be achieved with unobserved causal variables, given a generalized notion of faithfulness. Our results guarantee that we can recover the latent causal model up to an equivalence class and predict the effect of unseen combinations of interventions, in the limit of infinite data. We implement our causal disentanglement framework by developing an autoencoding variational Bayes algorithm and apply it to the problem of predicting combinatorial perturbation effects in genomics.},

  abstract = {In this work, we revisit the global average pooling layer proposed in [13], and shed light on how it explicitly enables the convolutional neural network (CNN) to have remarkable localization ability despite being trained on imagelevel labels. While this technique was previously proposed as a means for regularizing training, we find that it actually builds a generic localizable deep representation that exposes the implicit attention of CNNs on an image. Despite the apparent simplicity of global average pooling, we are able to achieve 37.1\% top-5 error for object localization on ILSVRC 2014 without training on any bounding box annotation. We demonstrate in a variety of experiments that our network is able to localize the discriminative image regions despite just being trained for solving classification task1.},

  abstract = {Image-to-image translation is a class of vision and graphics problems where the goal is to learn the mapping between an input image and an output image using a training set of aligned image pairs. However, for many tasks, paired training data will not be available. We present an approach for learning to translate an image from a source domain \$X\$ to a target domain \$Y\$ in the absence of paired examples. Our goal is to learn a mapping \$G: X {\textbackslash}rightarrow Y\$ such that the distribution of images from \$G(X)\$ is indistinguishable from the distribution \$Y\$ using an adversarial loss. Because this mapping is highly under-constrained, we couple it with an inverse mapping \$F: Y {\textbackslash}rightarrow X\$ and introduce a cycle consistency loss to push \$F(G(X)) {\textbackslash}approx X\$ (and vice versa). Qualitative results are presented on several tasks where paired training data does not exist, including collection style transfer, object transfiguration, season transfer, photo enhancement, etc. Quantitative comparisons against several prior methods demonstrate the superiority of our approach.},
