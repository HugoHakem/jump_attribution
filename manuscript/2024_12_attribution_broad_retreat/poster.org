*** Abstract
With the Cell Painting assay we quantify cell morphology using six dyes to stain eight cellular components: Nucleus, mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, nucleoli, cytoplasmic RNA, actin, golgi aparatus, and plasma membrane. After high-throughput fluorescence microscopy, image analysis algorithms then extract thousands of morphological features from each single cell’s image. By comparing of these “pro files” we can can uncover new relationships among genetic and chemical perturbations.


Here, we describe how this data can now be used to answer many biological questions. Researchers can pick any gene of interest and find what morphological phenotypes are induced when it is knocked-out or overexpressed and what genes produce a similar morphological pro file when altered, uncovering functional relationships. Novel software tools developed for this dataset empower biologists to make discoveries of their own, and we show that mining this dataset can yield novel insights into current and relevant biological questions.

*** Morphological pro files were generated at a high-throughput scale
We generated and preprocessed a database composed of thousands of cell painting experiments.

*** We generated a reference dataset for cells and features that indicates clustered groups of genes
After applying batch correction, it becomes possible to query individual genes and find similar pro files. Precomputed distances for morphological profiles are made available.

*** The JUMP consortium produced a massive set of morphological pro files

A gallery to fetch all the available images for a given perturbation.

*** Which other perturbations produce a phenotype similar to my gene of interest?
We developed an ecosystem tools for scientist to find the perturbations most similar to theirs.

*** Which features are the most significant for my gene of interest?
Statistical values of all features for a given perturbation.

*** A standard analysis workflow has the following steps:
1. Find the most correlated and anticorrelated genes.
2. Find the features that show highest variance between these correlated/anticorrelated candidates.
3. Use these feature to guide comparisons between perturbed cells and negative controls.
4. Fetch images for these perturbations for inspection
5. Retrieve additional annotations from existing databases.
   
*** We provide libraries for data scientists and developers
